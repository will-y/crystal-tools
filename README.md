# Crystal Tools
This mod adds a new class of tools to Minecraft called crystal tools. They are meant to be a post-netherite tool that can keep getting better as you use it.

Please report any bugs you find in the Issues tab or in the comments.
You can also suggest features or ask questions there.

## Blocks
Currently, there are three blocks added to the game

- Crystal Ore
- Deepslate Crystal Ore
- Crystal Block

## World Generation
Deepslate Crystal Ore Generates Below Y -44 in veins of size 5.
The ore generates very rarely, currently only about one vein per chunk.

## Tools
Tools gain experience by using them. You can see how much exp you need to get to the next level by looking at the tooltip. You can open the skill tree by pressing `k` by default. Skill points can be using to get a new skill or to fully repair your tool.

The following tools/armor pieces are implemented:

- Crystal Pickaxe
- Crystal Axe
- Crystal Shovel
- Crystal Hoe
