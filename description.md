# Crystal Tools
This mod adds a new class of tools to Minecraft called crystal tools. They are meant to be a post-netherite tool that can keep getting better as you use it.  
**Warning: Updating to 0.2.0 could change some upgrades on Axes only. Future updates should no longer change existing tools after this update.**

This is an early beta version of the mod. More features to come soon.
Please report any bugs you find in the Issues tab or in the comments.
You can also suggest features or ask questions there.

## Blocks
Currently, there are three blocks added to the game
- Crystal Ore
- Deepslate Crystal Ore
- Crystal Block

## World Generation
Deepslate Crystal Ore Generates Below Y -44 in veins of size 5.
The ore generates very rarely, currently only about one vein per chunk.

## Tools
Tools gain experience by using them. You can see how much exp you need to get to the next level by looking at the tooltip. You can open the skill tree by pressing `k` by default. Skill points can be using to get a new skill or to fully repair your tool.

The following tools are implemented:

- Crystal Pickaxe
