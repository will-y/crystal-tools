# Levelable Entities
## Overview
Some entities can be given certain items to allow them to level up!

Currently, the only levelable entity is a pet dog. Right-click on a tamed wolf (that you own)
with a <ItemLink id="crystal_collar" /> to allow it to start gaining skill points! You can shift right-click on the wolf afterwords to get access
to the skill tree.
