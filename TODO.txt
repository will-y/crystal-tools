    - Filters
- If I'm getting into things like hoppers, chests, backpacks, might want to think about some other way to level things up

- Pressing k with no tools will go to equipped items, buttons at the top of the screen to arrow between equipped / held items
- Auto crafter
- Button in upgrade screen to convert exp to tool levels (5 levels?)
- When I have to do the big refactor, maybe try tags and events instead of needing my own type
- Limit to infinite nodes (breaking json change so wait until 1.21)

- 3x3 is a little weird with ores
- Packet interface
