----------- At Some Point ------------------
- See what happens when tool runs out of durability while vein mining
- Better Auto Repair (in hand repair)
- Bow Draw Speed
- Boots immune to fall damage
- Armor cool potion effects?
- Auto smelt things in 3x3 and vein mining (Still no clue)
- Add 3x3 vs 1x1 to mode switch
